## What Makes a Good PowerPoint Presentation?

Creating an effective PowerPoint presentation requires balancing visual appeal with readability and clarity. This guide outlines evidence-based best practices for professional presentations.

## Typography & Text

### Font Size
- **Minimum text size:** 18pt (critical requirement)
- **Recommended body text:** ≥24pt for optimal readability
- **Title text:** ≥32pt for clear hierarchy

**Why it matters:** Text smaller than 18pt becomes difficult to read from the back of a room. Larger text forces you to be concise and ensures accessibility.

### Font Consistency
- **Limit fonts to 2 maximum** (typically one for headings, one for body text)
- Stick with professional, readable fonts like Arial, Calibri, or Helvetica
- Avoid decorative or script fonts for body text

**Why it matters:** Too many fonts create visual chaos and appear unprofessional. Consistency builds credibility.

### Word Count Per Slide
- **Target:** ≤50 words per slide
- **Ideal:** 20-30 words for maximum impact

**Why it matters:** Slides should support your verbal presentation, not replace it. Audiences cannot read dense text whilst listening to you speak.

## Colour & Contrast

### Contrast Ratios
- **Minimum contrast ratio:** 4.5:1 (WCAG AA standard)
- **Recommended:** 7:1 for better accessibility
- Test text against background colours using contrast checkers

**Why it matters:** Poor contrast makes text unreadable, particularly for colour-blind audience members or in brightly lit rooms. High contrast ensures everyone can follow along.

### Colour Usage
- Use colours purposefully, not decoratively
- Maintain consistent colour schemes throughout
- Avoid red/green combinations (problematic for colour blindness)

## Layout & Structure

### Bullet Points
- **Maximum:** 6 bullet points per slide
- **Ideal:** 3-5 points for clarity
- Keep bullet text to one line when possible

**Why it matters:** Too many bullet points overwhelm the audience and suggest you're trying to fit too much on one slide. Break complex topics into multiple slides.

### Slide Titles
- Every content slide should have a clear, descriptive title
- Titles help orient your audience and improve navigation

### Visual Balance
- Include images on 30-70% of slides for engagement
- Don't overload slides with too many images (creates clutter)
- Ensure images are high-quality and relevant

---

## Presentation Length

### Slide Count
- **Recommended maximum:** 20 slides for most presentations
- **Ideal for 10-minute talk:** 10-12 slides
- Rule of thumb: 1-2 minutes per slide

**Why it matters:** Attention spans are limited. Fewer, well-crafted slides are more effective than many cluttered ones.

### Estimated Speaking Time
- Allow approximately 150 words per minute speaking rate
- Add 30 seconds minimum per slide for visual processing
- Build in time for questions and discussion

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Text too small** - Nothing below 18pt, ever  
❌ **Wall of text** - If your slide looks like a document, redesign it  
❌ **Poor contrast** - Light grey text on white backgrounds  
❌ **Too many fonts** - Looks unprofessional and distracting  
❌ **Cluttered slides** - White space is your friend  
❌ **Empty slides** - Every slide should have purpose  
❌ **Reading from slides** - Your slides support you, not replace you

## Final Tips

1. **Design for the back row** - If someone in the last seat can't read it, it's too small
2. **One idea per slide** - Don't try to cram multiple concepts together
3. **Use visuals wisely** - Images should clarify, not decorate
4. **Practise your delivery** - Great slides still need great presentation
5. **Test in the actual space** - Check visibility and readability before presenting
